TODO
====

- replace static text with locales
  - use wowace's localization web site?  Can we do that if it's not in their SVN?

- figure out why "everyone is ready" is displayed twice on ready check

- consider adding a mana check to go auto-not-ready (and auto-ready when you go back up)

- change statechange.lua's wall-o-case into a matrix that defines what changes for each transition

- make debug setting part of profile and changeable at runtime

- make minion skinnable

- add libsink support when raid status changes
