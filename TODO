TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- get acedboptions working again

- clean up gui (critical members should be a listbox with buttons to delete or clear, field to add

- figure out why "everyone is ready" is displayed twice on ready check

- consider adding a mana check to go auto-not-ready (and auto-ready when you go back up)

- add a proper traffic light graphical frame (toggleable on/off)

  - states: you ready, raid ready = green
            you ready, raid not = red
            you not ready, raid ready = yellow
            you not ready, raid not ready = red
            
  - mouseover shows ready state

- use the same event to drive changes to the traffic light frame
