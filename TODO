TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- get acedboptions working again

- clean up gui

- remove debug code

- optimize status counters, do in situ as updates come in instead of iterating

- consider passing raid parameters like updateinterval from the raid leader via aceserializer

  - avoids problem where someone with a low update interval will constantly consider someone with
    an interval > 3 times theirs to be stale and in need of a ping
    
  - for now, just disable the option to change the update interval (during beta)

- figure out why "everyone is ready" is displayed twice on ready check

- consider adding a mana check to go auto-not-ready (and auto-ready when you go back up)

- add a proper traffic light graphical frame (toggleable on/off)

  - states: you ready, raid ready = green
            you ready, raid not = red
            you not ready, raid ready = yellow
            you not ready, raid not ready = red
            
  - mouseover shows ready state

- change update of LDB text to be event driven

- use the same event to drive changes to the traffic light frame

- selfready to a number so we can use 'STATUS ' .. tostring(self.selfready)

- replace UpdateRoster with add new memember to roster when receiving update

- add initial scan of the raid roster that sets everyone to STATE_NEW

- when RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE fires, just walk our member list, removing anyone who isn't in the raid any longer

- do we still need to periodically scan the roster (5 mins?) in case we miss someone leaving?  need to see how it
  performs in raids.  Perhaps we can check our total vs the raid members total and trigger a re-scan if the numbers
  are different.  That doesn't completely insulate us if we miss both someone leaving and joining, but it gets us
  close in a lightweight fashion.
  
- we could also do a check after someone was marked as "no addon" for some large multiple of the update interval
  and if they were no longer in the raid, trigger a re-scan or just remove them
