TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- get acedboptions working again

- clean up gui (critical members should be a listbox with buttons to delete or clear, field to add

- figure out why "everyone is ready" is displayed twice on ready check

- consider adding a mana check to go auto-not-ready (and auto-ready when you go back up)

- minion stuff
           
  - mouseover shows details like tooltip
  
  - appears/dissapears if minion is enabled or disabled at runtime instead of startup

- change statechange.lua's wall-o-case into a matrix that defines what changes for each transition

- get a better graphic.  done by someone who doesn't SUCK AT ART
