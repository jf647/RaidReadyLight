TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- add configuration dialog in interface menu

- optimize status counters, do in situ as updates come in instead of iterating

- offer simple tooltip that doesn't show all the exceptions

  - done, just needs a db setting toggler

- consider passing raid parameters like updateinterval from the raid leader via aceserializer

  - avoids problem where someone with a low update interval will constantly consider someone with
    an interval > 3 times theirs to be stale and in need of a ping
	
  - for now, just remove the option to change the update interval (during beta)
