TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- get acedboptions working again

- clean up gui

- remove debug code

- consider passing raid parameters like updateinterval from the raid leader via aceserializer

  - avoids problem where someone with a low update interval will constantly consider someone with
    an interval > 3 times theirs to be stale and in need of a ping
    
  - for now, just disable the option to change the update interval (during beta)

- figure out why "everyone is ready" is displayed twice on ready check

- consider adding a mana check to go auto-not-ready (and auto-ready when you go back up)

- add a proper traffic light graphical frame (toggleable on/off)

  - states: you ready, raid ready = green
            you ready, raid not = red
            you not ready, raid ready = yellow
            you not ready, raid not ready = red
            
  - mouseover shows ready state

- use the same event to drive changes to the traffic light frame
