TODO
====

- find out how to do debug and to enable debug in an addon

- replace static text with locales

- add configuration dialog in interface menu

* move roster to a more complex structure

	* add another state (assumed ready) for people who don't have RRL

	* add message type to addon message (use AceSerializer?)

	* add ping and pong messages, sent directly from one member to another

	* states: unknown, ok, pinged, norrl

	* ready state: true or false (irrelevant unless state = ok)

	* when adding someone to the roster for the first time, set state to unknown and and schedule timer
	  for 3 * interval to do a ping

	* when receiving an update from someone, set state to ok

	- need timestamp when someone was last active (for unknown, time when added to roster,
	  for ok time of last status message, for pinged time of ping sent)
	  
	- when ping event fires, mark as pinged, send whisper message to the user and schedule a timer for
	  2 * interval to mark as norrl
	  
	* status report needs to show:

	  - people with RRL who are ready
	  
	  - people with RRL who are not ready
	  
	  - people without RRL
	  
	  - people who are unknown
	  
	- for the LDB status line, need to show ready of roster total

	- in the tooltip, need to break down the categories above

	- max not ready is compared against those with RRL only
