TODO
====

- replace static text with locales

- get acedboptions working again

- clean up gui

- remove debug code

- optimize status counters, do in situ as updates come in instead of iterating

- consider passing raid parameters like updateinterval from the raid leader via aceserializer

  - avoids problem where someone with a low update interval will constantly consider someone with
    an interval > 3 times theirs to be stale and in need of a ping
	
  - for now, just disable the option to change the update interval (during beta)
